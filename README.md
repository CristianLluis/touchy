# Touchy

I created this app for my girlfriend as a way to stay connected while she is abroad in another country very far away ðŸ’”. **OVER 9000 (km)** to be precise. The purpose of Touchy is to create an interactive experience for two (or more) people who want to feel closer, no matter the physical distance.

The app allows users to log in, touch their screens, and see glowing effects where their fingers are. If the glowing areas overlap, the devices vibrate to simulate the feeling of touch - Because sometimes, holding hands across the internet is the only thing we can do ðŸ¥°!

### **How It Works**

- **Interactive Glow**: When you touch the screen, it creates a glowing effect around your finger.
- **Real-time Sync**: You can see where the others are touching the screen in real time.
- **Shared Vibration**: If glowing areas overlap, the devices vibrate gently to simulate a shared connection.

### **Tech**

The app is built with: Vue 3, Django, Postgres
